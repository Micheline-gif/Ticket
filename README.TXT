How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

2. The value returned is 0 after printing the ticket
3. 
5. The only difference in the ticket is the price. Everything else looks the same
6. They both start with "public class ClassName"
7. Yes it matters, because when you change the code to "class public TicketMachine" it says error and won't compile and the diagram has red strips in it. 
8. Yes it's possible to leave public. It doesnt change anything and will let you compile. 
9. It is not possible to leave out the word class because it is a requirement in the code. Won't let you compile either.
11. 
12. private int count : Primitive type
    private Student representative : Class type
    private Server host : Class type
13. private boolean alive : name is alive
    private Person tutor : name is tutor
    private Game game : name is game
14. The class names are "Student", "Server", "Person", "Game"
15. Changing it to "private price int;" puts an error in the codes and adds red stripes in the diagrame.
    Changing it to "int private price;" puts an error in the codes and adds red stripes in the diagrame.
    Changing it to "int price;" everything stays normal and compiles
    (The orders does matter for "private int price;") 
16. The semicolon at the end of a field declaration is necessary because when you remove it, it tells you "';' excepted"
17. private int status;
18. The Student class
